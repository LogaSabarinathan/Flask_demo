# Flask_demo

This is a Note website where the user can register themselves and can add up their personal notes into the website.

Here we used **Flask** as our backend framework.

Also used **Flask_Login** and **Login_Manager** which takes care of user login sessions.

For database, **SQLite** is being used.
